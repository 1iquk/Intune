# Get Autopilot HWID
This batch file automatically runs the Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo.ps1 script and appends the Hardware Hash ID into the csv file.
These 2 files need to be stored in the same folder.
It can be run from the Windows desktop in any folder or caan be run from the OOBE by pressing Shift+F10. (some laptops Shift+Fn+F10)

The files can be stored and run from any folder including paths which have spaces.

Please make sure you edit the GroupTag in the batch file or edit the csv file later on before uploading to Intune.
