# Autopilot_HWID_1.2
This batch file automatically runs the Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo.ps1 script and appends the Hash ID into the csv file.
These 2 files need to be stored in the same folder and run from the root of any drive.
This can be run from the OOBE by pressing Shift+F10.

Please make sure you edit the GroupTag in the batch file or edit the csv file later on before uploading to Intune.
